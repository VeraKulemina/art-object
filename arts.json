      "details": "This was Delacroix’s first major painting and it was immediately accepted and praised by those who favored the romantic movement. It is a passionate allegory featuring Dante in his red cap alongside Virgil, a Roman pagan poet, who gave him the first guided tour in history—a tour of hell!"

      "details": "The Pastoral Concert by Titian is symbolic of many things but it is a fantasy above all else. In a time when most people were illiterate, symbolism in paintings is what constructed stories for observers. If you had been alive in the 16th century, you\"d know that the two nude women were magical visions."

      "details": "The Battle Between Love and Chastity is an allegory depicting the internal battle our European ancestors faced. Pietro Perugino’s painting connects us with that struggle, which is why I believe it is one of the most important and famous paintings in the Louvre. Importantly, it helps us understand the minds of women in the 16th century."

      "details": "Raffaello Santi or Sanzio, known as Raphael, a painter of the High Renaissance, is the son of the official painter of the court of the Duke of Urbino, Giovanni Santi. His style is characterized by an almost equal use of drawing and colour because, unlike many painters, he does not let one dominate the other; he is as precise in the line as in the distribution of colours as in the vanishing point."
